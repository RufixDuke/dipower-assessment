### Running the App

1. Start the Metro Bundler:

### Troubleshooting

- **Error: "Could not find expo in this project directory"**: Make sure you have Expo CLI installed globally on your machine. You can install it using `npm install -g expo-cli`.
- **Error: "Failed to compile"**: Check if there are any syntax errors or missing dependencies in the code. Try running `npm install` again to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
